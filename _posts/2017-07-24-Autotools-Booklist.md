# Autotools Booklist

This is the booklist for learning the autotools, such as autoconf, automake,
libtool.

+ {info, man} {autoconf, automake, libtool}
+ Autotools

Autotools are some tools to generate and manage the project to different
plaforms end users. You should learn them together, for they are used
together. It is really abstract for some one, so, one should learn them more
patient. So I recommend you to learning these tools after you have been
familiar with software projects.
