# Sed & AWK Booklist

This is a book list for sed and awk learning

+ {info, man} {sed,awk}
+ sed&awk
+ The awk programming language
+ Effective awk programming

**PS**: sed's advantage is to search and replace the text, what's more, it also
used to format the raw txt data, it is very useful in dealing with text line.
awk is a powerful text manipulating tool, it's syntax can also become a
programming language. Its strength is in dealing with text colum and making
report. All these two can work greatly well with regex, so you should learn
regex first.
