# Grep & Find Booklist

This is a book list for grep and find tools in Linux.

+ {info, man} {grep, find}

**PS**: Both grep and find are used to search string, however, grep is usually
used in searching string in text file, then find is usually used in searching
the files in the system, so they are different. grep can work with regex, you
can study regex when learning grep. find is very useful in dealing with system
searching trancation. If you just want to just a simply and fastly searching,
you can use locate to do it. xargs is a great CMD to let a CMD to process
multi-file, it is vary useful and effective, but you should think about a
mount out the file it use just one command line to finish the job.
