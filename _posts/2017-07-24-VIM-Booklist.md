# Vim Booklist

This is a book list for vi/vim editor.

+ Learning the vi and Vim Editors
+ Practical Vim
+ Pro Vim
+ Use Vim as IDE
+ vi and Vim Editor Pocket Reference
+ vim :help

**PS**: The vi and Vim are great and powerful editors, Vim means Vi IMproved, so
Vim are more powerful than vi. Though the fisrt time you use Vim you will feel
that Vim is simple GUI editor and even broken, but once you get to know Vim
and farmiliar with it, I think you will love it and never get rid of it. You
can configurate your own Vim by editing the .vimrc and adding the plugins in
Vim, after that, you will feel more comfortable to work with this simple and
'broken' editor, trust me!
