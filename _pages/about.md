I am ishbguy, a system administrator in an industrial software company. My
major is not computer science, but as a hoby, I luckly get a job to join in
this domain.

This is my first blog and it is based on github page. The reason why I choose
github page to build my own blog is that I can write pages for my blog without
renting a VPS and administrate a server by myself.
